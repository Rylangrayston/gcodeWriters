to create a timelapse where the end video looks like purple neon highlighter has draw some text 
do the folowing 


1 slice a modle so that you get a gcode file
2 open the gcode file from your slicer in a text editor and delete all but one layer
3 change the name of your gcode file to layer.gcode 
4 make sure layer.gcode and layerToSequence.py are in the same folder
5 from the terminal type  python layerToSequence.py
6 you will now have a file called ouput.gcode 

6.5 edit the arduinoCameraControl.ino to have an exposure time greater than that of the time it take the printer to draw layer.gcode once. 

7 next load arduinoCameraControl.ino onto an arduino and phisicaly conect pin 8 such that when it goes to 5 volts it holds the shutter of your cammera open 

7.5 using git checkout tkpeachyprinter 
branch no_audio 
HEAD e84505cd356448daee56e4bffca0d2c19d4da8d9

8 open the peach software with python peachyprintertools -d
9 change your dripper setting to use the cammera z axix feature and ensure that the layer delay is about 1 second longer that the longest exposrue your cammera will do
